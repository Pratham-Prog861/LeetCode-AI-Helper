## How It Works

1. **Problem Detection**: The extension detects when you're on a LeetCode problem page.
2. **Data Extraction**: It extracts the problem title and description from the page.
3. **AI Processing**: Sends the problem data to Gemini AI with specific instructions based on your selection.
4. **Response Formatting**: The AI responds with hints, approach, or code, which is displayed in the popup.
5. **Secure Storage**: Your API key is stored securely using Chrome's sync storage.

## Troubleshooting
